# TAWE-Library

This project was created and managed by (CS) Group 26 from Swansea University 2nd Year Computer Science Student group in 2018.

How to compile
Open the command line and proceed to go into the directory of the source code.
Once inside, type "cd tawe-library" (This folder is where all source files are).
You can now compile the file and run it by using "javac Main.java" and "java Main".

Unable to compile?
If you have little to no luck compiling, you can launch Eclipse and open the project by:
File > Open Projects from File System > open directory > tawe-library
This should sort all the files into their correct places & if you run Main.java it will work.
